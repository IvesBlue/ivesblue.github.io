👋 Hi, I’m @IvesBlue.<br>
👀 I’m interested in Pyth0n and Scrapy Crawling framework.<br>
🌱 I’m currently learning Pyth0n.<br>
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on various Crawling projects.<br>
📫 How to reach me? You can find me on Jaspravim.sk as IvesBlue user.<br>

I think you should use an
<python>element here instead</python>
